      <p class="about-text">
        I first got into <span class="highlight">development</span> after high school, thinking I was good with computers (mainly because I played video games). However, I quickly realized I didn't know much about programming itself. I struggled with basic algorithm problems early on, but I was determined to learn. I spent countless nights understanding the fundamentals—things like <span class="highlight">loops</span> and <span class="highlight">variables</span>—and eventually got hooked on coding. Over time, I found my passion in <span class="highlight">software development</span> rather than algorithmic challenges, and that's when everything clicked.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        During my first year studying <span class="highlight">computer science</span>, I built a simple chess game in Python, and despite the messy code filled with hundreds of "if" conditions, I was immensely proud when it worked! That project marked the beginning of my journey as a software developer. Since then, I've worked on various projects, ranging from small games and CRUD applications to mobile apps and cross-platform solutions. My proudest achievement was fully developing a <span class="highlight">SaaS product</span>, handling the entire development process from coding to testing and deployment across multiple environments.

        I hold a <span class="highlight">Master's in Software Engineering</span> from <span class="highlight">Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier</span>, and have had the chance to work with great companies like <span class="highlight">Sopra Steria</span> as a full-stack intern and <span class="highlight">Thales</span>, where I'm currently working as a <span class="highlight">Software and DevOps Engineer Apprentice</span> in the <span class="highlight">Air Traffic Management sector</span>

        I'm actively seeking new opportunities to continue developing my skills as a software engineer while contributing to a team that's passionate about creating innovative solutions. If you think I'd be a good fit, let's connect and discuss how I can add value to your team!

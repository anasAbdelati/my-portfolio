    <p class="intro">
      I first got into <span class="keywords">development</span> after high school, thinking I was good with computers
      (mainly because I played video games). However, I quickly realized I didn’t know much about programming itself.
      I struggled with basic algorithm problems early on, but I was determined to learn. I spent countless nights
      understanding the fundamentals—things like <span class="highlight">loops</span> and <span class="highlight">variables</span>—and eventually
      got hooked on coding. Over time, I found my passion in <span class="highlight">software development</span> rather than algorithmic challenges,
      and that's when everything clicked.
      <br><br>
      During my first year studying <span class="highlight">computer science</span>, I built a simple chess game in Python, and despite the messy code filled with
      hundreds of "if" conditions, I was immensely proud when it worked! That project marked the beginning of my journey as a software developer.
      Since then, I’ve worked on various projects, ranging from small games and CRUD applications to mobile apps and cross-platform solutions.
      My proudest achievement was fully developing a <span class="highlight">SaaS product</span>, handling the entire development process from
      coding to testing and deployment across multiple environments.
      <br><br>
      I hold a <span class="highlight">Master’s in Software Engineering</span> from <span class="highlight">Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier</span>,
      and have had the chance to work with great companies like <span class="highlight">Sopra Steria</span>
      as a full-stack intern and <span class="highlight">Thales</span>
      , where I’m currently working as a <span class="highlight">Software and DevOps Engineer Apprentice</span>
      in the <span class="highlight">Air Traffic Management sector</span>
      <br><br>
      I'm actively seeking new opportunities to continue developing my skills as a software engineer while contributing to a team that’s passionate about creating innovative solutions. If you think I’d be a good fit, let’s connect and discuss how I can add value to your team!
